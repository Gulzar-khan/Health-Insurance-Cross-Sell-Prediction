## **ðŸ“–Introduction:**

As we all knew Cross-selling involves selling customers related items when they are making a purchase. It's important not only because it boosts revenue, but also because it increases customer satisfaction, builds engagement, and helps to create solid and lasting customer relationships.

Cross-selling insurance allows you to earn additional profit without the cost of searching for new leads. Additionally, you build your client relationship by staying up to date on events and changes in your client's lives which might require new or greater coverage. This can lead to improved client retention.

Our client is an Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers now they need our help in building a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.

After getting your model reports company can do some Digital marketing and automation to grow insurance agency in the field of vehicle insurance through cross-selling and increase their revenue via investing in reproductive marketing campaign.

## **ðŸ“–Problem Statement:**

Insurance is the process by which companies commit to guaranteeing compensation for specified loss, damage, illness, or death as reimbursement for a specific premium.

Like medical insurance, there is a car insurance policy where every year the customer needs to pay a premium to the insurance company so that in the event of a car accident, the insurance company will provide compensation (called a 'guaranteed amount') to the customer.

The objective of this project is to build a Model to predict whether the policyholders from the past year will also be interested in vehicle insurance provided by the same company. Creating a prediction model that a customer can be interested in Car Insurance is very helpful for the company as it can effectively plan its communication strategy to reach those customers and increase its business model and revenue.

Now, in order to predict, whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, you have information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), Policy (Premium, sourcing channel) etc.

## **ðŸ“– Abstract:**

Just like medical insurance, there is vehicle insurance where every year customer needs to pay a premium of certain amount to insurance provider company so that in case of unfortunate accident by the vehicle, the insurance provider company will provide a compensation (called 'sum assuredâ€™) to the customer. Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.


## **ðŸ“–Dataset:**

1. id: Unique ID for the customer

2. Gender: Gender of the customer

3. Age:  Age of the customer

4. Driving_License 0: Customer does not have DL, 1: Customer already has DL

5. Region_Code: Unique code for the region of the customer

6. Previously_Insured: 1: Customer already has Vehicle Insurance, 0: Customer doesn't have Vehicle Insurance

7. Vehicle Age:  Age of the Vehicle

8. Vehicle_Damage :1: Customer got his/her vehicle damaged in the past. 0: Customer didn't get his/her vehicle damaged in the past.

9. Annual_Premium: The amount customer needs to pay as premium in the year

10. PolicySalesChannel:  Anonymized Code for the channel of outreaching to the customer ie. Different Agents, Over Mail, Over Phone, In Person, etc.

11. Vintage: Number of Days, Customer has been associated with the company

12. Response:  1: Customer is interested, 0: Customer is not interested


Number of instances: 381109

Number of attributes: 12

## **ðŸ“–Approach:**


We will divide this project into three steps for reproductive analysis.

As the first step we will be analyzing, cleaning the dataset which was provided and dropping some unnecessary column.

In the second step we are handling outliers as well as finding the distribution type of all numerical features and try to understand the skew-ness of them.

In the third step we will draw some insights after fetching all the details from all features like Age distribution, vehicle damage status and policy premium. After that we will do Feature selection and Engineering. In FE we will be using f_classification and correlation both method for Removing Some unnecessary column as well as we will do some encoding for categorical features also.

In the Fourth step we will split our data into train and test set and due to unbalance nature of our data we will use some balancing techniques on train set and after that we prepare our data for feeding  to our models for training and analyze the results of all models by comparing with each other. We will select best model among these and proceed with them further.

In the last step we will do hyper-parameter tuning for our topmost model and will see how our model behaves with different parameters. After getting best parameter for our top models we will go for feature importance method and draw the weightage of all features for our top model.

Based on above steps we will find the best model which can be good enough for predicting Response of policyholders. By using these model we can increase our marketing conversion drastically and help to move forward towards cross-selling our vehicle insurance to our policyholders. In long term cross-selling can helps customers to feel satisfied, Build loyalty and Increase earning also because if cross-selling increases customer satisfaction, youâ€™ll save money by spending less time and resources on customer acquisition.

## **ðŸ“–Project Workflow:**

2. Loading the dataset

3. EDA on features

4. Feature Engineering

5. Feature selection

7. Applying some technique

8. Fitting the classification models

9. Cross validation and HyperParameter Tuning

10. Final selection of the model

11. Feature importance

12. Conclusion

## **ðŸ“– Conclusion:**

Our client is an insurance firm that has supplied Health Insurance to its customers. They now need assistance in developing a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from the previous year will be interested in the company's Vehicle Insurance.

Building a model to predict if a client is interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely beneficial to the company because they can then plan communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.

Now, we have information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), vehicles (vehicle age, damage), policies (premium, sourcing channel), and so on to predict whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance.


### **Key points:**

1. Customers of age between 30 to 60 are more likely to buy insurance.

2. Customers with Vehicle_Damage are likely to buy insurance.

3. Customers with Driving License have higher chance of buying Insurance.

4. The variable such as Age, Previously_insured,Annual_premium are more affecting the target variable.

5. We can see that LGBM model preform better for this dataset.


### **Improvements:**

1. By using a marketing and advertising approach, we can reduce the gender gap.

2. We can clearly see that we have a larger number of consumers without vehicle insurance, therefore we can easily target them directly with our campaign.

3. Since there are less policy holders with vehicles older than two years, we must pay more attention to the other two categories (1-2 years and >1 year). Because most sales agencies that offer vehicle insurance for the first year are actually our target and we can give them the best incentives to reduce competition in the market.

4. As we saw that we have nearly equal policy holders for both vehicle damage status, so we can target those policy holders whose vehicles are damaged in the past.
