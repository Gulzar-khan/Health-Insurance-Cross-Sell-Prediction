**Problem Statement:** 

Insurance is the process by which companies commit to guaranteeing compensation for specified loss, damage, illness, or death as reimbursement for a specific premium.

Like medical insurance, there is a car insurance policy where every year the customer needs to pay a premium to the insurance company so that in the event of a car accident, the insurance company will provide compensation (called a 'guaranteed amount') to the customer.

The objective of this project is to build a Model to predict whether the policyholders from the past year will also be interested in vehicle insurance provided by the same company. Creating a prediction model that a customer can be interested in Car Insurance is very helpful for the company as it can effectively plan its communication strategy to reach those customers and increase its business model and revenue.
